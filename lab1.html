        <title>Challenge: You can learn text tags</title>
        <meta charset="utf-8">

    <body>
        <p>
        Nobody’s born <em>smart</em>. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to <strong>10</strong>.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, <strong>we are born to learn</strong>.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. <em>learning</em>.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.

<h1>Great Big Words</h1>
<h2>by Michael Mark & Tom Chapin</h2>

<p>When I was a little kid,
a "<em class="big">diminutive juvenile</em>," <br>
I liked my folks to read to me,
I was an <em class="big">"eager bibliophile."</em> <br>
Now I love words for how they sound <br>
And how they <em class="big">"communicate."</em> <br>
Perhaps I should explain myself,
that is, <em class="big">"elucidate."</em> <br>
Great big words, I like <em class="big">big</em> words. <br>
Letter by letter, the <em class="bigger">bigger</em> the better <br>
Great big words. La la la la la la la la la la!</p>

        <div class="info"><p><span class="first-sentence">Groupers are teleosts (ray-finned fishes), typically having a stout body and a large mouth.</span> They can be quite large, and lengths over a meter and weights up to 100 kg are not uncommon, though obviously in such a large group, species vary considerably. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it. They do not have many teeth on the edges of their jaws, but they have heavy crushing tooth plates inside the pharynx. They habitually eat fish, octopuses, and crustaceans. Reports of fatal attacks on humans by the largest species, the giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) are unconfirmed.
            
        </p></div>

        <div class="info"><p><span class="first-sentence">Their mouths and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks their prey in from a distance.</span> They also use their mouths to dig into sand to form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills. Their gill muscles are so powerful, it is nearly impossible to pull them out of a cave if they feel attacked and extend those muscles to lock themselves in.
